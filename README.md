# RouteX
The RouteX is an interactive platform to verify the authenticity of the product and take logistics operations on-chain. The user can have confidence that they are purchasing genuine products and not counterfeits. It actually provides the whole supply chain operation like adding products or updating product locations to maintain a secure channel for verifying the provenance of the products. It's more convenient for users to scan QR and get all relevant product details. Check out our flow for a better understanding.
